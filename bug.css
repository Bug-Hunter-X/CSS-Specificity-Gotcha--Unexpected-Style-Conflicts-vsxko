The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.class1 div {
  color: red;
}

#id1 .class1 div {
  color: green;
}

#id1 div {
  color: purple;
}
```

In this example, the specificity of the selectors determines which style will be applied to an element with the id "id1", class "class1", and a child div. The ID selector (#id1) has the highest specificity, followed by the class and element selectors. Therefore, the "color: purple" declaration will override the other color declarations.
